# NeoRust
NeoRust is an integral component of my initiative to introduce Rust to the Neo ecosystem. NeoRust is currently in an active development phase.

I will leverage NeoRust for the creation of various projects, including a `TEE-secured Neo wallet`, a `Secure Neo node`, `Neo middleware`, `Neo-ZK rollup` solutions, and more.

Supported by [R3E Network](https://github.com/R3E-Network) and [GrantShares](https://grantshares.io/app/details/155b825697b61f9f95292c8e466f6891), other supports are welcome.
